# rover-esp8266

It is intended to be a simple replica of a Martian rover, focusing the design on the rocker-bogie suspension system and the shape of the wheels. 
It has no cosmetic add-ons, and is simple to print and mount. In addition to the molded components, it requires the electronics, screws, some square tubes and a wood plate. 
The rover is controlled by a web application. The source code is available on GitHub. Total cost should be below 300$
